Anyone who's spent more than 30 seconds with me while I work is aware that

> I'm a sucker for third-party apps to try and speed up my day-to-day

One of the questions I get asked *often enough* is **"Do you have any recommendations for apps?"** - this post is an effort to try and capture the applications I've decided are **mandatory** for me at work. 

## TLDR

In summation - here's my list of Mandatory Mac Apps:

* Raycast
* Notion
* Hyper
* Beeper

## Let's talk price

While some of the apps here are free (as in beer), some of the items mentioned in this list will require a one-off purchase, or a subscription. While I'm happy to pay for software, I'm on a constant

| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💵   | Paid App - Either a one-off, or a subscription.            |
| 🏪   | SetApp - Can be accessed via [SetApp](https://setapp.com/) |
| 🐧   | Open Source - Feeling friendly? Contribute now!            |
| 🆓   | You guessed it - totally free                              |
| ❓    | Limited Release - you may need an invite                   |

## The Big Ones

I read a weird amount of "best apps" lists (there are weirder things to do in your spare time), and I've noticed there's a lack of detail surrounding some of the more *configurable* apps out there. 

These apps are powerhouses straight out of the tin, but can be **extended** to be even more powerful through customisation and configuration. Below are my favourites

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 🆓

VS Code is one of those applications that *everyone* who has anything to do with Web Development recommend. It's fast, has a comprehensive library of plugins, and is seeing regular updates. There are other text-editors out there worth trialing ([Zed](https://zed.dev/) is on my list to check out!), VS Code never fails to disappoint.

If you're interested in the Plugins I use, check out the [linked section](#VS-Code-Extensions).

### [Arc](https://arc.net/) 🆓❓

Arc has really changed the way I use the browser. I was a Chrome Tab wizard once upon a time, and given the vast majority of my professional work is done in the browser - **having a reliable and fast internet browser is crucial for my wellbeing.**

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/capnsammeh/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto,w_400/v1713000334/CleanShot_2024-04-13_at_19.23.35_bx6s72.gif "Arc - Browser Inception")

There are a heap of reasons I use (and recommend!) Arc, but the big ones are:

* Multiple Spaces to help seperate Work, and Projects within Work
* AI-File Renaming is 👌 and the only reason my Download folder isn't worse
* Window-Synchronisation lets me have 3 or 4 instances of the same Space open, and persist the browsing experience across each of them - meaning there's no fear of wondering "Did I hit save..?" when I alt-tab. 
* OmniSearch works *awesomely* and really gets me where I need to be quickly and efficiently - even across heaps of different Spaces. 

If you're keen to try out Arc, why not use [my referral code](https://arc.net/gift/e6367a6b)?

### [Raycast](<>) 🆓

Spotlight search is one of the more highly utilised applications on my device, but since discovering Raycast, it's **completely superseded the native Spotlight Search.** 

Raycast is FAST, it's ***powerful***, and it has a comprehensive suite of Extensions available from within the Store. It's augmented with AI (if you're into that sort of thing), and enables a bunch of my productivity. 

It's also replaced quite a few applications for me, as it has a lot of the features I go to other apps for built in, or available as plugins.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/capnsammeh/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto,w_400/v1713131642/CleanShot_2024-04-15_at_07.52.32_2x_r5uauv.png "Raycast")

My mandatories when it comes to Extensions are:

1. Brew
   - For quick installations/removal of applications via Homebrew 
2. Calendar + My Schedule
   - Gives me visibility of my upcoming meetings, and a means to join then from 3 keystrokes
3. CleanShotX
   - CleanShotX has a bunch of awesome features, but I always forget the complicated chords to access the shortcuts. This lets me quickly type "OCR" (for example) to access the OCR function of CleanShotX.
4. Clipboard History
   - Bound to CMD+SHIFT+V, having all of my clipboard at the ready is extremely useful. 
5. Color Picker
   - Seems like a simple one, but being able to quickly identify a specific color for reuse is VERY handy in front-end development. 
6. MS Teams Meetings
   - Allows me to manage things like my Microphone and Webcam quickly from Raycast - can also be bound to keyboard shortcuts for global management of device access.
7. Navigation
   - Lets me search the menu items of the given window - really handy for accessing hidden or less-used functions without having to leave the home row. 
8. Spotify Controls
   - Seems like a no-brainer, but being able to Pause+Skip etc regardless of which keyboard I'm using (some have media controls, other don't) is a godsend. 
9. Timers
   - My lil' ADHD brain sometimes need a kick to get going. Timers really helps create the artificial pressure I need to GSD (Get Shit Done). 
10. Window Management
   - The creme de la creme of Raycast Features (imho) - completely replaced Rectangle, Swish, etc. and has become *the only* way I manage windows on my device.
