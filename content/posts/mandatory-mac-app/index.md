Anyone who's spent more than 30 seconds with me while I work is aware that

> I'm a sucker for third-party apps to try and speed up my day-to-day

One of the questions I get asked *often enough* is **"Do you have any recommendations for apps?"** - this post is an effort to try and capture the applications I've decided are **mandatory** for me at work. 

## TLDR

In summation - here's my list of Mandatory Mac Apps:

* Raycast
* Notion
* Hyper
* Beeper

## Let's talk price

While some of the apps here are free (as in beer), some of the items mentioned in this list will require a one-off purchase, or a subscription. While I'm happy to pay for software, I'm on a constant 

| Icon | Description                                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💵   | Paid App - Either a one-off, or a subscription.            |
| 🏪   | SetApp - Can be accessed via [SetApp](https://setapp.com/) |
| 🐧   | Open Source - Feeling friendly? Contribute now!            |
| 🆓   | You guessed it - totally free                              |
| ❓    | Limited Release - you may need an invite                   |

## The Big Ones

I read a weird amount of "best apps" lists (there are weirder things to do in your spare time), and I've noticed there's a lack of detail surrounding some of the more *configurable* apps out there. 

These apps are powerhouses straight out of the tin, but can be **extended** to be even more powerful through customisation and configuration. Below are my favourites

### 🆓 [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

VS Code is one of those applications that *everyone* who has anything to do with Web Development recommend. It's fast, has a comprehensive library of plugins, and is seeing regular updates. There are other text-editors out there worth trialing ([Zed](https://zed.dev/) is on my list to check out!), VS Code never fails to disappoint.

### 🆓❓ [Arc](https://arc.net/)

Arc has really changed the way I use the browser. I was a Chrome Tab wizard once upon a time, and given the vast majority of my professional work is done in the browser - **having a reliable and fast internet browser is crucial for my wellbeing.**

There are a heap of reasons I use (and recommend!) Arc, but the big ones are:

* Multiple Spaces to help seperate Work, and Projects within Work
* AI-File Renaming is 👌 and the only reason my Download folder isn't worse
* Window-Synchronisation lets me have 3 or 4 instances of the same Space open, and persist the browsing experience across each of them - meaning there's no fear of wondering "Did I hit save..?" when I alt-tab. 
* OmniSearch works *awesomely* and really gets me where I need to be quickly and efficiently - even across heaps of different Spaces. 

If you're keen to try out Arc, why not use [my referral code](https://arc.net/gift/e6367a6b)?
