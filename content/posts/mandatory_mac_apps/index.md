Anyone who's spent more than 30 seconds with me while I work is aware that

> I'm a sucker for third-party apps to try and speed up my day-to-day

One of the quetions I get asked *often enough* is **"Do you have any recommendations for apps?"** - this post is an effort to try and capture the applications I've decided are **mandatory** for me at work. 

## The Workhorse - Daily Driver
Right now, my Daily Driver is a *14-Inch 2021` Macbook Pro M1* and I can't complain about it at all. I've had no issues with compatibility, and the device is an all-around champion - great battery life (I use it as a battery bank for my phone when I fly!), nice screen, good keyboard, and (perhaps most importantly) *it's blazing fast*. 

## TLDR
In summation - here's my list of Mandatory Mac Apps:
* Raycast
* Notion
* Hyper

## The Big Ones
