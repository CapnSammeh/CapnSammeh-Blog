# Sam's Blog - Netlify + Hugo + Zappier

Github Repo that acts as the backend for [Sam's Blog](https://samherring.netlify.app). Powered by Hugo, Netlify and Zapier, and themed with the amazing [Blowfish](https://nunocoracao.github.io/)

# Running in Dev
## Hugo
Running the Hugo Development Server is easy!
```
hugo server
```

## Netlify CMS Gateway Proxy
Use the Netlify CMS Proxy Server NPM Package to act as a CLI Gateway Proxy for the Dev Builds so we don't break anything by mistake. 
```
npx netlify-cms-proxy-server
```
